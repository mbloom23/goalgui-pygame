# goalgui-pygame

Here, I use the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library to implement a GUI for a smart soccer goal product I built with a team of engineers. The GUI reports the location of a shot on goal and the speed of the shot, which are sourced from an Arduino's serial line and the physical sensors in the goal. The full details of the project are contained in the poster PDF hosted here, but it revolves around using laser diode and photoresistor pairs to localize the ball.
